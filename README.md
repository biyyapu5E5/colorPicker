## Event Delegation

Adding Event on parent element instead of adding it to every child element.

### Why Use Event Delegation?
#### Performance: 
Fewer event listeners = better performance, especially with many child elements.

#### Scalability: 
Easier to manage dynamically added elements.

#### Cleaner code: 
Less repetitive code.
